This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust related to mutable borrowing.  The `bug.rs` file contains code that attempts to create multiple mutable references to the same variable, leading to a compile-time error. The `bugSolution.rs` file shows how to resolve the issue using techniques like cloning, passing values, or refactoring the code to avoid the conflicting borrows.
